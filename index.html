        <h2>Everything You Can Think Of; Nothing You Want</h2>
        <p class="subhead">Overview</p>
        <p>The theme for the 2020 graphic design biennial is “Everything You Can Think Of; Nothing You Want.”</p>

        <p>“Everything You Can Think Of” and “Nothing You Want” correspond to two separate but related bodies of work—like two sides of a coin, informing one another—housed in one biennial. The show seeks to highlight the tension of a graduate-level practice: the professional and educational; individual and institutional; commercial and critical. Students can submit to both bodies of work.</p>
        
        <p class="subhead">Everything You Can Think Of</p>
        <p>“Everything You Can Think Of” represents graphic design as a wide field. It speaks to the multimedia, multidisciplinary work produced by RISD students from their varied perspectives and modes of practice. “Everything” also invokes the program’s ambition and rigor. RISD students are constantly producing and publishing their knowledge and creative work; we are always making everything we can think of. “Everything” ought to be an imaginative and diverse show, flaunting the ingenuity and extensive skill of RISD graphic designers.</p>

        <p>For “Everything”, each student is limited to one submission. The submission must have been included in your RISD application or produced for a RISD class or event. Submit work that you are proud to have created at RISD: work that is portfolioworthy, work RISD would want to share on social media, etc. Any format is acceptable (book, motion, web, etc.), but it must evidently be graphic design. You may include didactic text or other context.</p>

        <p class="subhead">Nothing You Want</p>
        <p>RISD values students’ productive capacity. However, many things important to wellness or daily living are not productive: rest, nourishment, social activity, child care, appointments, and self-care. “Nothing You Want” is critical of how the institution conceals and devalues what does not produce value in its name. “Nothing” seeks documentation of ‘unproductive’ things. Submissions might include performance, audio, writing, graphic design, objects, napping, truancy, crying, protest, theft—anything ‘worthless’ to the institution.</p>

        <p>“Nothing” is a refusal: a rejection of the biennial format, of the expectation that students exhibit work so that RISD’s branding, recruiting, and rankings might benefit. “Nothing” asks us to reassess who a biennial ought to serve and what a biennial ought to contain. And further, “Nothing” speaks to a need to reexamine what the industry at large finds valuable. This show consequently also abdicates the task of curation, instead offering unlimited, unrestricted space for submissions. Ultimately, “Nothing You Want” reveals the cost of “Everything You Can Think Of.”</p>

        <p>This shadow show is unlimited and uncurated. For “Nothing,” students can submit infinite items, produced at any time, in any format.</p>
